# Intro

This folder contains the version of the first weekend of the Raytracing in one weekend series.

# Building

Currently it depends on the stb_image as suggested by the tutorials.

## Windows

It makes use of Visual Studio 2022, and third party dependecies are expected to have been installed via vcpkg.

## POSIX OSes

For the time being I am ignoring them until CMake and the respective compilers have proper support for C++20.
